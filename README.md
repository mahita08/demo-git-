# Demo Git Repository

This is the first file in this repo.

## BOOOOO
I am trying to upload a Ruby app to Heroku. I start with git init and then I type git add . and then I use git commit -m initial commit.
Whenever I use git commit -m, I receive an error message saying:
git commit error:pathspect 'commit' did not match any file(s) known to git.
I have been told that this is happening because the arguments are in the wrong order.
The thing I noticed is that when I use git add . it will not list the files that are being added because it will just go to the next line.
I suspect that I am having this problem because my files are not really being added.
I would appreciate any advice about how to correct this problem.
